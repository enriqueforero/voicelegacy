"""voicelegacy — Quality scoring for reference-audio candidates.

The single most important driver of clone quality is the reference audio.
This module scores candidate segments so we can keep the top N and discard
the rest, instead of feeding XTTS-v2 noisy or short fragments.

    Scoring rubric (higher = better):
        score = snr_normalized * duration_factor

    Where:
        - snr_normalized in [0, 1] from min_snr_db (0) to 40 dB (1).
        - duration_factor in [0, 1] peaks at the midpoint of the allowed range
          and falls off symmetrically outside it.

    A segment is considered passing if it clears all hard gates:
